## here are some things about me

* I'm a second year PhD Student in Dr. Daniel Katz's lab at Cornell University
* I study tree flowering and pollen production
* I recently took up long distance running! I'm running my first marathon in November, so I spend most of my free time running with friends
* I love to cook. My latest kitchen obsession is harissa, tahini, carrot/raisin salad
